            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>Aspiring to pursue a PhD in Computer Science leveraging my robust academic background and research experience to contribute to the advancement of the field. With a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Computer Science, two peer-reviewed publications, and practical experience as a graduate assistant with CODERS and ROSE Grant—a program dedicated to training K-12 teachers in computer science education—I am eager to delve deeper into innovative research. My goal is to explore cutting-edge technologies and methodologies aiming to make significant contributions to both academic research and practical applications in computer science. I am particularly interested in areas such as IoT, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer science education, with a strong desire to develop solutions that bridge the gap between theory and practice.</p>
